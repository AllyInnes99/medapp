I can definitely see a usecase though (e.g generating information in a more accessible format for visually impaired users)",2,"This could be useful, but it also seems very situational - if you're downloading a prescription management app, you're probably needing to take medication on a recurring basis.",2,"Could be useful for the multi-user suggestion (i.e for carers, a care home could use one account that's updated by many members of staff), but not major for me unless I lose a device or get a new one.",4,"Useful to identify gaps in medication, say when I'm explaining things to my doctor."

As long as users have access to their google account, such a feature will ensure the user has access no matter their situation.",3,"Such a feature can be useful for carers. However, other parties should have access to their own technology",5,This drastically improves the ease of use of the application as some users who suffer from dyslexia and other reading conditions may struggle to type and read the complex names of prescriptions.,4,Not all users will be comfortable sharing this data on these types of applications. Having the ability to chose what medication is shared gives users complete control over their sensitive information.,5,"Accounts would allow users to transfer their data across a wide span of devices. This can also help users who may be unsure at their current prescription situation and have a lack of their own technology at that point in time. For example, the user could simply log onto a friend/family members device, check their information, then log off without leaving behind any information.",4,Such a feature allows for a brief check up to remind the user if they have or have not taken their medication as well as when they last supplied. This can be particularly useful from users in the older demographic who may suffer from some form of memory loss.
